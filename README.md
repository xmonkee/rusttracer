A ray-tracer written in Rust. 

I have adapted Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8) for this project. The original code in C++. This was a way for me to learn Rust. 

The project implements various types of materials, camera placement, anti-aliasing and scene composition. 
Future work: a dsl for describing scenes
